CROSS-PLATFORM
1. ✅ compile to android with tauri

BUILD
1. ✅ Figure out how to build regardless of ts errors -- have disabled `tsc -b` during build

RADIX
1. Add/replace react-select and react-modal with Radix primitives

AUTH
1. ✅ add AuthContext -- so far I've just mocked it with useQuery
1. ✅ add signOut action to AuthContext -- correction: mocked it with its own hook
1. ✅ figure out "redirect to home screen" on logout 
1. auth guard redirect with redirectedFrom param
1. @TODO in the _auth/login.tsx - why using hooks? we should have this already


NAVIGATION
1. ✅ get back the "active/inactive" link style in sidebar.tsx
1. properly use the disabled option on the nav links
1. ✅ probably set it to only active-match exact route matches
1. don't forget to add the Navbar back in
