MOBILE
1. compile to android with tauri
1. compile to ios with tauri

BUILD
1. ✅ Figure out how to build regardless of ts errors -- have disabled `tsc -b` during build

AUTH
1. ✅ add AuthContext -- so far I've just mocked it with useQuery
1. ✅ add signOut action to AuthContext -- correction: mocked it with its own hook
1. ✅ figure out "redirect to home screen" on logout 
1. auth "guard" redirect with beforeLoad


NAVIGATION
1. ✅ get back the "active/inactive" link style in sidebar.tsx
1. properly use the disabled option on the nav links
1. ✅ probably set it to only active-match exact route matches
1. don't forget to add the Navbar back in

MISC utilities
1. replace useLang with router feature
1. double check the new pluck works the same with if (key in obj)
