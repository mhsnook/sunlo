AUTH
1. ✅ add AuthContext -- so far I've just mocked it with useQuery
1. ✅ add signOut action to AuthContext -- correction: mocked it with its own hook
1. ✅ figure out "redirect to home screen" on logout 

NAVIGATION
1. ✅ get back the "active/inactive" link style in sidebar.tsx
1. properly use the disabled option on the nav links
1. ✅ probably set it to only active-match exact route matches

MISC utilities
1. replace useLang with router feature
1. double check the new pluck works the same with if (key in obj)

BUILD
1. ❔ Have disabled `tsc -b` during build; I'm not sure if this foregoes some optimisation,
    but I was really just looking for this option like dangerouslyIgnoreBuildErrors.
