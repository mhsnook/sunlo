## 0.2 - Social Features and New Data Management

_November 2025_

Since April we have added direct messages, realtime connections for friend requests, alert badges
to help users discover features and important interactions.

And we have opened up a new feature
realm with the addition of "Phrase Requests", allowing you to describe a situation you're in and
what you want to communicate, and ask native speakers to answer with a flash card that will prepare
you for similar situations in the future. This "requests" concept provides a cross-language meta-
layer, describing what linguists call "messages" (the actual _thing_ you want to convey), which
mirrors the way people actually learn languages in the real world: by asking a friend or colleague
who speaks the language already, "Hey, when I want to hail a cab, what do I say?"

In the next phase, this "Requests" concept will become the basis for additional social features,
and will allow us to identify _across all languages_ which types of cards will be most useful for
learners of other languages, to help us make the most out of our crowd-sourcing model, so that work
put into one language can be used to ease the path for others.

To make these more interactive and more social features perform better on device, and require less
bandwidth and re-fetching from the server, this version also include a major upgrade to the way
data is fetched and stored on device, using Tanstack DB's live queries for all data in the app.

This release contains the minimum feature set for an enjoyable flash card-learning experience.

Users can create cards, add translations, and perform reviews with the Spaced Repetition system,
