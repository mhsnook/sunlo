# Instructions for the Coding Agent

1. Please start by picking one item from the list provided, with `STATUS: PENDING` or `STATUS: READY` that looks simple enough to tackle and does not require any explanation or interaction with other issues. If the item contains an ISSUE or PR number, use the Github CLI to look it up and read the information from Github. All items will be found in `https://github.com/mhsnook/sunlo/...`, which is also the remote `origin`.
2. Attempt to resolve the issue or complete the feature, writing tests and using the formatter and linter to validate your work.
3. Each item lists a "COMPLEXITY" score from 1 to 4. This should tell you how much effort we think you should be putting in to each try.
   1. If an item feels like a `COMPLEXITY: 4` or `DIFFICULTY: 4` then please create a new document for it in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-{project-name}-project-doc.md`, move your thoughts from this document to that one, and just leave a note here saying "this looked like a `size=4` so I moved it.
   2. For items that look like a 1, 2, or 3, try them up to 3x before giving up; mark the item `STATUS: BLOCKED` and leave a comment.
   3. Use the existing test framework, with `pnpm run test` to confirm your work didn't break anything, but if there are pre-existing broken tests that prevent you from being sure, simply leave a note and move on. You can spend a little time trying to clean up adjacent tests, but do not go too far out of scope.
   4. You can use your own browser to click through and test the feature. You can write tests based on your successful navigation. You can add `data-testid` and related attributes throughout the app's JSX components to make all this easier. Never use `page.goto`. Not all tests need to be `mutation` tests; you can also just use them to click around and ensure things navigate and show up as we would expect.
   5. If you need to ask questions to the human engineering manager, simply add them to the document along with the item below, and skip the item, marking it `STATUS: QUESTIONS`.
4. When you have finished an item, update the status or reached the retry limit, or determined that you require more clarification from the human manager, write a note in the document along with the item, and next to the `COMPLEXITY` rating, record _your own score_ for `DIFFICULTY`, based on your own experience working on, researching and analysing the item. Once you have this note you can move on and we will be able to forget about the discussion later but retain the relevant details in the log.
5. If you have completed the task, perform a git commit with a concise summary of the work. If the task involves migrations, put it on another branch with the format: `2026-01-10-{concise-item-name}`, commit it over there, and then return to today's working branch before continuing. Finally, add a commit-message sized description in the list at the top of the document.
6. Go back to step 1 for as long as there are more PENDING items.
