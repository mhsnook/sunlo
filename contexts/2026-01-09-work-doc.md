# Sprint Doc

Today's branch: `dev/9th-jan`. Completed items:

- [x] (c3, d3) When you try to add a phrase but you don't have a deck for that language, a checkbox gives you the option to start learning (or re-activate) that deck, or to create the new phrase without one.
- [x] (c2, d2) Deck-configurable preferred translation lang
- [x] (c1, d1) Fix Typescript Errors in Bulk-Add.tsx

## Instructions for the Coding Agent

1. Please start by picking one item from the list below with `STATUS: PENDING` or `STATUS: READY` that looks simple and does not require any explanation or interaction with other issues. If the item contains an ISSUE or PR number, use the `gh` cli to read the information from github. All items will be found in `https://github.com/mhsnook/sunlo/...`, which is also the remote `origin`.
2. Attempt to resolve the issue or complete the feature, writing tests and using the formatter and linter to validate your work.
3. Try the item up to 3x before giving up; mark the item `STATUS: BLOCKED` and leave a comment.
4. Each item lists a "COMPLEXITY" score from 1 to 4. This should tell you how much effort we think you should be putting in to each try.
5. If you need to ask questions to the human engineering manager, simply add them to the document along with the item below, and skip the item, marking it `STATUS: QUESTIONS`.
6. When you have finished an item, or reached the retry limit, or determined that you require more clarification from the human manager, write a note in the document along with the item below, so that you can forget our discussions later but retain this log. Update the DIFFICULTY score from 1 to 4 based on your experience so far working on the item. Make sure the STATUS is updated appropriately.
7. If you have completed the task, perform a git commit with a concise summary of the work.
8. Go back to step 1 as long as there are more PENDING items.

## Items to Work On

CHANGES TO INTEGRATE INTO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE APP:

- Modified the `add_phrase_translation_card` RPC function to accept an optional `create_card` boolean parameter (defaults to true for backward compatibility)
- Added deck status detection to both add-phrase and bulk-add pages using `useDeckMeta(lang)`
- Implemented conditional checkbox UI: "Start learning X" for new decks, "Re-activate X deck" for archived decks
- Checkbox only shows when user has no deck or an archived deck for the language
- When checkbox is checked, the mutation creates/reactivates the deck before adding the phrase
- Updated toast messages to indicate both phrase creation and deck actions
- Fixed a pre-existing test issue where the test expected "Select language" but the form now defaults to user's first known language

### Feature B: "Public" mode so you can browse feeds / playlists / requests / phrases without a login

STATUS: READY
COMPLEXITY: 3
DIFFICULTY:

DESCRIPTION FROM HUMAN MANAGER:
This is a self-explanatory feature but implementation may be complex. A bunch of components may need to be hidden when the user is not logged in, or they may need to trigger a dialog "go sign up/log in" when you try to take an action, etc. It's fine to keep the functionality really minimal (nice ever) in "public mode", so hide as often as you want. Some menus will still be wanted, like the native share button, copy link, and all navigations.

NOTE FROM CODING AGENT:

#### ANALYSIS

##### Current Implementation

- All content routes are under `/_user` which requires authentication (src/routes/\_user.tsx:28-43)
- `beforeLoad` checks `context.auth.isAuth` and redirects to `/login` if false
- No public browsing routes exist for feeds, playlists, requests, or phrases
- Public collections (phrases, playlists, requests) already sync for all users

##### Files Impacted

**Major Changes:**

1. **Route Structure**:

   - Create new route layout: `/src/routes/_public.tsx` (optional auth)
   - Move or duplicate routes:
     - `/_user/learn/$lang.feed.tsx` → `/_public/browse/$lang/feed.tsx`
     - `/_user/learn/$lang.playlists.tsx` → `/_public/browse/$lang/playlists.tsx`
     - `/_user/learn/$lang.requests.tsx` → `/_public/browse/$lang/requests.tsx`
     - `/_user/learn/$lang.phrases.$id.tsx` → `/_public/browse/$lang/phrases/$id.tsx`
   - OR: Modify existing routes to work with optional auth

2. **Components Needing Conditional Rendering**:

   - Navigation (show "Login/Signup" instead of user menu when not authenticated)
   - Action buttons (Add to deck, Create playlist, etc.) - show "Login to..." dialog
   - Comments section - allow viewing but not posting when not authenticated
   - Upvote buttons - redirect to login when clicked
   - User profiles - show limited info when not authenticated

3. **Auth Context**:
   - Update `MyRouterContext` to handle `isAuth: false` gracefully
   - Update `titleBar`, `appnav`, `contextMenu` to work without auth

##### Implementation Options

**Option A: Duplicate Routes (Safer)**

- Create separate `/_public` layout with duplicated route files
- Keep `/_user` routes unchanged for authenticated users
- Easier to maintain different experiences
- More code duplication

**Option B: Shared Routes with Conditional Auth (Recommended)**

- Create `/_optional_auth.tsx` layout that doesn't redirect
- Move shared routes (feed, playlists, requests, phrases) here
- Use conditional rendering: `{auth.isAuth && <ActionButton />}`
- Less duplication, single source of truth
- Requires careful conditional logic throughout

**Option C: Keep Existing Routes, Remove Auth Check**

- Remove redirect from `/_user` beforeLoad
- Add conditional checks throughout all components
- Riskiest - easy to miss auth checks
- Could expose private data if not careful

##### Recommended Approach: Option B

###### Implementation Steps:

1. **Create Optional Auth Layout** (`/src/routes/_optional_auth.tsx`):

   ```typescript
   export const Route = createFileRoute('/_optional_auth')({
   	beforeLoad: ({ context }) => ({
   		// No auth check, but pass auth state through
   		auth: context.auth,
   		titleBar: { title: 'Browse' },
   	}),
   	loader: async () => {
   		// Preload public collections only
   		await Promise.all([
   			languagesCollection.preload(),
   			phrasesCollection.preload(),
   			phrasePlaylistsCollection.preload(),
   			requestsCollection.preload(),
   		])
   	},
   	component: PublicLayout,
   })
   ```

2. **Create Public Browse Routes**:

   - `/browse/$lang/feed`
   - `/browse/$lang/playlists`
   - `/browse/$lang/requests`
   - `/browse/phrases/$id`

3. **Create Reusable Hook** for auth-dependent actions:

   ```typescript
   export function useRequireAuth() {
   	const { auth } = Route.useRouteContext()
   	const navigate = useNavigate()

   	return useCallback(
   		(action: () => void) => {
   			if (!auth.isAuth) {
   				toast.error('Please login to continue')
   				navigate({ to: '/login', search: { redirectedFrom: location.href } })
   			} else {
   				action()
   			}
   		},
   		[auth.isAuth, navigate]
   	)
   }
   ```

4. **Update Components** with conditional rendering:

   ```tsx
   // In feed items, playlist items, etc.
   const requireAuth = useRequireAuth()

   {
   	auth.isAuth ?
   		<Button onClick={() => addToDeck()}>Add to Deck</Button>
   	:	<Button onClick={() => requireAuth(() => {})}>Login to Add</Button>
   }
   ```

5. **Update Navigation**:

   - Show "Browse" menu item for non-authenticated users
   - Hide user-specific items (My Decks, Profile, Friends)
   - Show "Login/Signup" button prominently

6. **Minimal Features in Public Mode**:
   - ✅ View feeds (phrases, playlists, requests)
   - ✅ View phrase details
   - ✅ Navigate between languages
   - ✅ Share buttons, copy link
   - ❌ Upvoting (show login prompt)
   - ❌ Commenting (show login prompt)
   - ❌ Creating content (show login prompt)
   - ❌ Adding to deck (show login prompt)

##### Questions for Human Manager:

1. Should public users be able to view user profiles? (privacy consideration) <Answer>Only public profiles, which they already know will be public.</Answer>
2. Should we show upvote counts in public mode, even if they can't upvote? <Answer>Yes</Answer>
3. Do we want a "Sign up to start learning" CTA on every page, or just in navigation? <Answer>Sure, add it; if I don't like it I'll remove it.</Answer>
4. Should public users be able to see the full phrase translation, or just a preview? <Answer>Show all information. Imagine it's like wikipedia -- even if they're not editors, they should have access to all the info and context.</Answer>

##### Estimated Difficulty: 3

- Requires significant routing changes
- Many components need conditional rendering
- Need to ensure no private data leaks
- Must test all user flows carefully
- Potential RLS policy review needed

LESSONS LEARNED:

### Analysis D: React Compiler

STATUS: PENDING
COMPLEXITY: 3

DESCRIPTION FROM HUMAN MANAGER:
Please analyse the code to determine whether we might benefit from, or be harmed by, the adoption of the react compiler, as it is now stable and promising to simplify code while maintaining or even improving client performance. If necessary, please create a new github branch and install the compiler and try it out. But do not commit anything on the current working branch, `dev/9th-jan`. The primary output

### Feature E: Friends feed should become polymorphic like the recent feed

STATUS: PENDING

### Fix F: sometimes the feed's "load more" adds items _higher up_ in the list (should only add below)

STATUS: PENDING

HUMAN MANAGER COMMENT: This seems to happen because of how phrase folding items get sorted in the list. I think we should make sure to use the EARLIEST created-at date for all the items in the folded set to prevent this from happening.
